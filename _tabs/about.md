ðŸ˜† Hey, I'm currently an AI student at KCL. I like programming and enjoy the idea of spotting subtle problems in our daily lives and using software programming to either solve them or make the process better. I am using blog posts here to note down some of the steps I went through for learning new things or setting up projects.

I also love movies and books, so I will also post some personal recommendations and share my thoughts about them.

### My fav movie:

 **Blade Runner** (Original and 2049) they are both equally good, but in different ways. I have also read the book, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" I was surprised by the huge difference between them. It's kind of like open-source software; each of them has made some improvements on the other. But the core of the story, the dystopian emotion, and the philosophical discussion are kept perfectly.

### My fav book:
 **Klara and the Sun** This book was definitely my introduction to the sci-fi world (yep, that's late). As you can see, I have a passion for all those dystopian stories. I think the story is charming and beautiful, and at the centre of those dystopian stories, the theme of themes is love. We humans are not perfect; what makes us human is our contradictory emotions, our selfishness, shame, and a lot of other not so good things. The texts are beautiful. Ishiguro has crafted a believable world there, and I feel like I was right there with Klara, looking at the sunset.
